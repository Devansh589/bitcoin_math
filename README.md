## Features

- **Zero Dependency**: This implementation does not rely on any external libraries, making it lightweight and easy to integrate.
- **Efficiency**: Designed for speed, this code optimizes common Bitcoin calculations.
- **Simplicity**: Clear and concise code that is easy to read and understand.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devansh589/bitcoin_math.git
```

Once cloned, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd bitcoin_math
```

You can now compile the code using a C compiler like `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -o bitcoin_math main.c
```

## Usage

To use the Bitcoin math functions, run the compiled executable:

```bash
./bitcoin_math
```

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the functions section below.

## Functions

This repository includes several key functions for Bitcoin mathematics:

### 1. Hashing Functions

- **SHA256**: Computes the SHA256 hash of the input data.
- **RIPEMD160**: Computes the RIPEMD160 hash of the input data.

### 2. Address Generation

- **Generate Address**: Create a Bitcoin address from a public key.
- **Validate Address**: Check if a Bitcoin address is valid.

### 3. Transaction Calculations

- **Transaction Fees**: Calculate the transaction fees based on input and output sizes.
- **Change Calculation**: Determine the change to return after a transaction.

### 4. Conversion Functions

- **Satoshi to Bitcoin**: Convert satoshis to Bitcoin.
- **Bitcoin to Satoshi**: Convert Bitcoin to satoshis.
